Next steps:
  Improve the movie recommendations by considering more movie attributes/features
  In our previous movie recommendations algorithm, we only consider their genres, which is a simple but
  good start. In addition, you can also consider the movie title, movie overview, languages and other relevant
  attributes to improve the movie similarity measurements.
  Add user management to extend the recommender to multi-users
  Refer to Django website to improve your app by adding user management
  Deploy the movie recommender on the cloud
